Hello World!  
<br/>
Just in case anybody is wondering, the site name comes from a poem, <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/153424-seven-times-i-have-despised-my-soul-the-first-time" target="blank"><i>Seven Times Have I Despised My Soul</i></a> written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahlil_Gibran" >Kahlil Gibran</a>. I kind of fell for this poem at first sight and since then having a website with "Seven Times Have I" became a top item in my check-list. And then let there be one.

This site is still under construction. But if you want to contact the girl who's working on it, ummm, just pick your favorite icon below!
